## Propose operator to compute model-based dice counts

#c.  Compute likelihood of challenge for prior opponent given [0, 1, 2, 3] of bid (max under cup) - not doing
#d.  Compute likelihood of opponents bid based on [0, 1, 2, 3]?
#e.  Pick lowest value where bid probability > challenge probability or where bid probability > .5 (some threshold).
#f.  If no 1 bid, assume average value for 1’s[impact is when thinking about biding 1’s and opponent bid something else – could assume ½ are the other value and ½ are 1’s.
