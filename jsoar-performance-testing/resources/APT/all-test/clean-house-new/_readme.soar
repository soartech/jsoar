## Support for using SMEM for maintaining block information. 
## Store block information with record-object
##    First test to see if already exists in smem by doing a query

## Delete objects not in current area in remove-objects 
## Retrieve using get-object/retrieve-blocks which will retrieve blocks that aren't in storage room
##    that have the right color
## Finished-cleaning is disabled - should fail in get-object and then do finish-cleaning
##   fail to get object in another room - fail to get unvisited room

## Support for using SMEM for maintaining area information. 
## Store area information with record-smem-current-area record-smem-new-gateway-area
##  Maintain storage area on top state once found
